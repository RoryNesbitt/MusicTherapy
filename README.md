# MusicTherapy
> This is the app I made along side my MSc IoT thesis

### Downloading
This app was created to be run with android studio  
To get this app first clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/RoryNesbitt/MusicTherapy.git
```
Then music has to be added to the assets folder. The direcotry structure should be assets/music/<mood number>/<music type>/mp3 file  
This will also display the name of the MP3 file though to correctly display the detiails it should be named <track name>.<artist>.mp3  
As as example here is the directory structure I use:
